<p>President&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/dilma-rousseff">Dilma Rousseff</a>&rsquo;s hopes of seeing out her term of office have received a potentially fatal blow after the biggest party in the Brazilian congress voted to abandon her ruling coalition.</p>

<p>The vote by the Brazilian Democratic Movement party (or PMDB) could trigger a defection from Rousseff&rsquo;s coalition by other smaller parties, and greatly increase the prospect that she will lose an impeachment vote in the lower house next month and be suspended from office.</p>

<p>To cries of &ldquo;Workers party out!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Onward Brazil!&rdquo;, PMDB leaders announced their decision to break up the coalition. All six remaining ministers in the cabinet will resign by 12 April.</p>

<p>Rousseff now leads a fragile minority government. Senior officials in the governing Workers party insist the president can still be saved from what they say is a coup attempt against an elected leader who still has more than half of her four-year mandate to serve.</p>

<p>But their efforts to shore up support look increasingly desperate after the PMDB &ndash; which has 68 of the 513 seats in the lower house &ndash; decided to leave an alliance that has propped up the government for more than 13 years.</p>

<p>David Fleischer, political science professor at the University of Bras&iacute;lia, said the defection would create a domino effect that is likely to topple Rousseff.</p>
